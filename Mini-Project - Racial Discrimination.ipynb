    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

From our data, it is evident that race has a statisitcal significant impact on whether an applicant is called back or not, with white sounding names having a much greater callback rate than blank sounding names from their resumes. The p-values calculated from the tests are both very low, and much lower than the .05 threshold required. Based on this, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude race impacts whether or not a resume will be called back.\n"

In order to attempt to prove this, we would likely need more data and conduct more tests on what determines whether or not a resume is called back, including many other factors such as gender, age, background, work history, whether or not the job requirements are met, and so on."
